<h1>State Management quiz 5/5/2019</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems?
        <p>We cannot bookmark POST request. If POST is bookmarked that means that parameters exist only on the URL and
            all form parameter is lost at that time. And web server doesn’t know what to do with the request because
            form parameters was lost but this parameter was expected.</p>
    </li>
    <li>What is the purpose of request dispatching?
        <p>Purpose of request dispatching is to forward request to another servlet and ask it to handle problem itself.
            Or include the request to another servlet or JSP and then finish operation in the same servlet.</p>
    </li>
    <li>What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch?
        <p>If used redirect so web server sends back to client another WAP page and client use it to sent another
            request. If used request dispatch so the request handle in the server and then result send back to
            client.</p>
    </li>
    <li>What is an attribute?
        <p>It is a pair with name and key, where name is String and value is Object. Used in ServletContext,
            HttpServletRequest and HttpSession.</p>
    </li>
    <li>What is the difference between attributes and parameters?
        <p>Parameter only used for reading information, but attributes is can be used for reading and write information.
            Parameter has only String type, attributes is object type.</p>
    </li>
    <li>What are dangers of using attributes?
        <p>Is accessed in all servlets and requests in the application. And thread safe only in request attributes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.
        <p>HTTP is stateless protocol it means that the every request doesn't keep any information about user or
            previous operations and states of this operations. But sometimes it needs to pass information of states
            between requests or user pages. For this case could be used cookies objects, that keeps in client side or
            sessions that used cookies to keep session ID. It possible to use hidden fields in HTTP forms.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one method). Container
        managed state (3 scopes)
        <p>1. Request scope is exist in servlet method that process this request and destroyed when servlet finished
            process this request.</p>
        <p>2. Session scope exist only while the browser is opened.</p>
        <p>3. When wab container closed the application scope is destroyed too.</p>
        <p>4. Cookies saved in client machine, deleted when browser closed.</p>
        <p>5. Fields on HTTP forms which hidden from user.</p>
    </li>
    <li>How long does a session last?
        <p>Is it possible to change the duration of session existence time.</p>
    </li>
    <li>What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last?
        <p>Cookies are files in the client computers. Cookies use to keep useful information in files that used by
            server. Temporary cookies deleted when user browser was closed. But permanent cookies have different time of
            existence and depends on of parameter of this cookie. Cookies could be kept for 12 months or longer.</p>
    </li>
    <li>What is the purpose of URL rewriting?
        <p>URL rewriting using to make URL more readable and make the meaning of this URL string according the stricture
            and information of the pages.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state demo?
        <p>If retuned result null so it is means that attribute by the given name is not exist. If is called method
            removeAttribute() for attribute it would have the same effect if is retuned null value of this
            attribute.</p>
